// javascript is asynchronous language and it has event loop which is used to handle asynchronous code 
// single threaded nature of javascript means that it can only execute one piece of code at a time
// but it can handle asynchronous code using event loop
// each operation waits for the previous operation to complete before executing
// blocking code vs blocking code
// blocking code is code that stops the execution of the program until it completes
// non-blocking code is code that allows the program to continue executing while it waits for the operation to complete
// asynchronous code is code that allows the program to continue executing while it waits for the operation to complete
// synchronous code is code that executes one line at a time and waits for the previous line to complete before executing the next line
